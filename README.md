A thin wrapper for [OpenLayers3](http://openlayers.org/) in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

The goal is to be able to write applications using OpenLayers maps in a declarative way. For example, the following is JSX, which can be returned by the render() method on a React component, to generate a map with a red square near the equator.

    <Map view=<View resolution={10000} center={[0, 0]}/>>
      <layer.Tile>
        <source.OSM />
      </layer.Tile>
      <layer.Vector>
        <source.Vector>
          <Feature style={{stroke: {color: [255, 0, 0, 1]}}}>
            <geom.LineString>
              {[[0, 0], [100000, 0], [100000, 100000], [0, 100000]]}
            </geom.LineString>
          </Feature>
        </source.Vector>
      </layer.Vector>
    </Map>

To understand what each element does, read the [OpenLayers API documentation](http://openlayers.org/en/v3.11.2/apidoc/).

### Styles

Are declared using a JSON object, passing through the properties you'd like on the final object.

When creating an Icon, Circle or RegularShape, a `type` parameter must be present, with the value of `icon`, `circle`, or `regular-shape`.

Example:

```
image: {
    type: 'circle',
    radius: 10,
    fill: { color: '#666666' },
    stroke: { color: '#bada55', width: 1 }
}
```

It's early days! If you're familiar with react and/or openlayers and are interested in helping, please get in touch. Available on [github](https://github.com/richardhills/ol-react) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol-react).

I am especially interested in assistance with having each component be optionally [controlled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). This would allow binding of the components with, say, Redux and for sophisticated state management outside of OpenLayers.
